 Hey! I’m @ClipzGit 😋
 but you can call me Cameron :)
 
 I have been interested in Software Development since 2017, 
 and ever since I have been self teaching myself programming and attending College courses. 
 
 Languages that I have thorough expierence in:
 - C# .NET 💻
 - HTML / CSS 🖌️
 - PHP **🐘**

Clearly I want to expand my knowledge, what is listed above isn't enough. I want to learn plenty more. 
So I hope my Git page can give you genuine interest in my projects and for my code to hopefully not trigger anyone (*sorry if i do*)
I hope my collaborations mean something, and we can all learn, improve together. 

Thanks for taking time to read my profile! 👋
